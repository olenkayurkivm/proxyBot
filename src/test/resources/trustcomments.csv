I felt the site is very user friendly and although I was nervous to answer the personal questions they were presented in a manner that helped me feel relaxed.
"Simple and straightforward process.  Clearly presented, so no questions."
"I have had a service with you guys in the past, I have recommended people to you as well."
Since I've had the emotional support life has been great . I didn't know about the yearly renew but I'm okay with that great service and thank you for the yearly reminder and making it so easy
I found your services to be very streamlined and user friendly. You guys truly delivered last year when I needed my ESA letter in a pinch. It was a natural choice to choose you for my ESA letter for 2019.
Renewing my ESA Travel letter and had lots of questions regarding new airline specific letters and they followed up quickly and answered all my questions clearly. you took an uncomfortable situation and made it as pleasant as possible.
Quick response from support team via Email when I had questions.  Fast and friendly service
"Very thorough, and straight to the point.  People within this company are very helpful when I have questions/concerns."
"I have been a client for almost 3 years . Best service, fast , and really professionals"
"So far it's been a good experience. Extremely stressed about everything going on, the ease of this process has helped ease some of that."
"Very easy, thank you! It was so fast, also. It couldn't have been better"
Very good experience. Wasn't difficult at all. I would recommend this service.
If this resource actually ends up working I will love this site forever.
I had a good experience by using this service but still waiting for the letter.
"very quick and easy, professional people who are empathic and competent."
"I am so thankful for this sight. Easy to use, very helpful and no hassles."
Love this online service. Turnaround was very fast and professional.  Lucky to have found this website!
"Service and responses are prompt, courteous, and helpful! I highly recommend."
"So far, process has been smooth.  Much better than ESA of America! I dealt with them for 5 years and will not return to them.  You answer your phones and are friendly!  They don't care about their customers!  They will not do airline forms either.  You offer many services which are helpful for people of disabilities now facing the dreaded airlines!  Thank you!"
First time to try your service and will definitely refer and be back if the order process is smooth and I receive my letter
Thank for your help and service  I will be happy to keep making business with them.
The site made it very easy to renew. I appreciate all the follow-up emails and reminders. Thank you!
I have used your services twice before and have always been happy with  my experience.
So far easy.  I am traveling again 12/20 and need the letters for the dogs before then.  Thank you!
"Received my letters within a week of my request. Very professional and well written. I haven't used either of them yet, but wanted to have them available for when I do. Therefore the final step is not complete until I use them but anticipate no problem."
"Was very easy, you only need to follow the directions and answer the questions"
The site is simple to use and the results will certainly be worth it to bring Penny to visit my family for the holidays!
Very user friendly and am glad to be able to complete the application on line
"Very very quick to reply, awesome customer service, always solving my problems! Thank you, what a blessing!"
I've been using this service for two years now and have never been disappointed!
"This has been the easiest renewal process for me, and my experience over the past year has been great. 0 issues with airlines or my apartment complex with my documentation."
"My mom used the service last year and everything worked great!  They updated letter with our requests in a timely manner.  The ability to get airline specific forms without hassle is great.  She got a letter from the state she lives in. I did not.  Its fine, but I would have preferred a letter from an in state doctor, or a closer state than hawaii when we live in PA.  But its still ok."
"Very well laid out, smooth process, easy functionality.Great experience."
Very highly recommended. The form is extremely easy to fill out and the expedited turnaround was lightning fast! Thank you for simplifying the process!
Became a patient last year and had such a pleasant experience that I've opted to renew a second year. Loved the quick response to my inquiries prior to purchase and really feel appreciated come this 2nd year renewal rate. Highly recommend!!
Everything arrived as stated and promptly. Thank you very much for your assistance!
We are very pleased with this service that has solved a major problem for us
"I believe this site made the process of allowing people like me to add legitimacy to my service animal. My pup adds so much support in my everyday life, and this program allows him to stay with me in all circumstances."
"Just filled out the initial questionnaire, and everything has gone smoothly so far!"
"I am happy and comfortable with this website , the questions are accurate and well asked"
I have recommended your services to many people!! Always fantastic response time and always helping to solve any problems with new airline policies. The best!!! Thank you
So far so good. I love to leave a great review after my first flight with my dog.
"Whenever I have a question, I get a response so quickly.  Thank you for making this stress free!"
Love this! So useful and legitimate. I don't know what I'd do without my dogs. Thank you!
Recommended by a friend. She had a very good experience with them. Will update after i get my ESA
I like that you get a text right away and can check the status of your ESA documentation.
Experience was good- fingers crossed this letter gets approved and I will be fully satisfied with my experience.
The process was helpful and I like that I can save the form in case I need more time to think about my choice.
Service is amazing. I cannot imagine life with my girl by my side. Thank you.
Really quick and affective. Extremely happy and satified with the turn around time and how the professional was able to quickly complete the airline form
I was happy to be able to anonymously apply for this certification as I am too embarrassed to ask my health provider.  But knowing that I can travel with my dog immediately puts my mind at ease and allows me to concentrate on other important things in my life.  Thank you.
So far so good! Haven't heard anything back from my apartment yet! Thanks Cole
"Thank you for being so utterly helpful and kind. I will recommend you kindly to all customers, friends and family."
Easy to fill out form. Got my letter and airline forms within 24hrs. I booked my flight and submitted everything to the airline and everything was approved so easily!
"Thorough, quick service. They ask a lot of question to make sure they are providing you with the recommendation."
I understand why the airlines revise their policies every so often.  It is just a real pleasure when sites like this one makes it easier to comply with the changes.    Thank you.
"I was a little skeptical because the assessment was at the forefront of the website, but we will see."
Only had a problem with uploading a photo to the website for the ID but as long as your Customers Support contacts me for the image I'd say you guys are 1 of the best services for ESA online especially with your specific airline request forms.
"This is the third year I have used GetEsa and each time they executed as stated.  Timely response, good follow up by the doctors."
I'm a returning customer and the experience has been smooth and simple. Thank You.
Your company has been excellent!!!  You have always come through for me on those last minute flights I've taken which required special forms to be completed.  I can't thank you enough!
efficient... and professional.  Thanks for including the option for the Airline specific forms.
The site was fairly easy to use.  I had made an error in processing and it was corrected in a timely matter.  Great customer service.
"As long is my letter is satisfactory, I am quite satisfied and will be recommending this to any of my friends who need similar products."
"I'll have a better sense once I actually receive the letter, but the questionaire was very clear & easy."
I hope I will receive by email my ESA letter allowing me to travel with my dog to CA to visit my daughters soon.
My overall experience has been great. I get a fast response and always am satisfied with the results. The staff is helpful and remains professional at all times.
I thought the signing up process was pretty harmless. I was scared but it was very easy
"So far very easy to use website. I asked for a representative to call me to get more information, an they did within the day! I am hoping this will be accepted by the airline! if not i will be back to post an update!"
The ease of use for my wife was terrific and for myself as well so far.  thank you
Great service always have received necessary forms and assistance. Thank you so much.
It was straightforward and simple to complete. I hope the remaining task to complete is as simple. I am grateful.
we found your company last year and it helped get my pets on a plane to see my family over the holidays.. It was a game changer. thank you for making it happen again this year.
"The process was quick and easy, and I felt that the questions would accurately describe my current mental state and need for an emotional support animal."
"Thank you for the help that you have done to this day and that you are continuing to do. People do not take you for granted and you have helped people tremendously, including myself, thank you!"
I am glad this site makes it so easy. Definitely is needed and to be able to take my ESA with me in apartment living.
So far it’s been a pleasant experience for such an unpleasant situation!
I appreciate this because of my pride. It's hard for me to say I have problems and own up to them in person. So thank you.
I love all of the option you give and how easy it is to fill out. Finally found a legitimate site for my ESAs and not a scam! Thank you so much
"Easy to fill out and submit, easy to renew, quick response time. Very good."
getting an esa letter to decrease my stress has been a stressful experience. getESA helped alleviate that stress
"So far, it was a simple process, but want to get the letter before I give final review."
"Great experience so far!  We just got done with the purchase and will be waiting for the review.  If that goes well, we will ABSOLUTELY come back here as often as needed."
"This is the first time I needed to renew this account, but so far I have been very thankful that I can have access to something i otherwise struggle setting up at a brick and mortar location. I do not get the common leisure of simply going out and running errands, so an online resource is best for a person like me."
Thank you for looking out for people like myself.
I love my pets and wouldn’t be able to work through emotional trauma without them . Thank you.
they are quick in any request I need since I register my pet a year ago!
So far so good. It has the best rate than other esa letter websites I've seen!
Best service I have ever experienced in my entire life. Thank you so much!
This site was easy to find creditable and was able to research on the site what I needed. Adding both of my dogs is a bonus!  And being able to pick up where I left off the day before
I feel hopeful that GetEsa will be a very helpful service that I can come back to year after year!
Easy and straight-forward. Hopefully my documentation will arrive in my inbox soon!
great service and very timely highly recommend. Flew with my pet numerous times now.
I'm interested in getting an ID card if it could an option for lower price
I am so pleased with how easy this process is. It's done quickly and completely and provides the proper documentation needed in order to travel with your emotional support animal.
I just made our first flight with my dog and it was such a comfort. It's a huge relief to know he can travel with me.
"Before doing this application. you awesome customer care support person name Valerie F. helped me out so much on explaining how everything works. thanks so much Lee for all the information, patience and support."
"Easy to use, thorough, and makes me feel that my personal info is safe!"
"I would highly recommend this website, responds super quickly. Helped me keep my best friend."
Both online options and who I spoke with on the phone have been wonderful regarding such a sensitive topic. We will continue to both use your services and recomend you to friends and family in need.
So far the process has been smooth and the professionals are quick to respond.
This was very easy while also being thorough. The documentation was accepted by my apartments.
"This is my second year using GetEsa. They are a great resource for ESA animals, resources and very reasonable in regards to price."
In-depth questions and straightforward process! I feel like I'm in good hands!
Thanks for making this an easy process!  Being able to type out why I need my emotional support pets is so much easier than verbalizing it out loud to someone.
"Quick and easy to renew! However, I do wish that the doctor used was from my state of residence."
"So far it was pretty easy. It was a bit frustrating because I tried to fill out the exam 2 times on Internet Explorer, and ended up having to go to Chrome for it to actually work."
"So far, the site was quick and easy to understand. I look forward to hearing from a professional so that I can get a letter to have my dog with me for emotional support."
Great service very fast and convenient! When I had questions they answer almost immediately!
"Very easy and straightforward. I have had to communicate with the psychologist regarding other concerns after the fact, and she has been wonderful and very easy to reach."
"Easier if I still had computer. Only have fire now! My problem, not yours"
Everything was easy & lots of information to help you understand your rights & the laws. It was hard to take a picture it did not respon & I started over several time because of the box with the area up. I kept hitting by accident & had to start over. Thank you. I hope u are able to help me.
It was fast and easy but also asked the right questions.  I felt safe talking about feelings and expressing my concerns .
This shopping experience was great- easy to follow and covered all the necessary information. I will definitely refer GetEsa to my friends.
Very happy with the initial purchase. Hopefully the forms ordered work with the airlines.
I have been using GetEsa for the past 3 years with excellent service and never had any problems with the airlines.
Website was easy to use. Process was simple and ESA documents were delivered as promised.
This is my 3rd year using this service and I'm very happy with efficiency and speed in which the process is completed! I highly recommend getESA!
i left a voicemail on number posted- received a call back within the 5 mins
the representative was knowledgeable and helpful
The questions were very easy to handle and a very quick examination which helped due to my anxiety I'm very easily distracted so it was immensely helpful
"The response time was quick and fast. Adding the link in the email was great, it helped me get to what I needed in a timely manner."
Customer service has been very quick to respond.  I asked a couple of questions and heard back within minutes of sending. Thank you!
I really liked the simplicity of this site. I get overwhelmed easily and it was nice to be able to express myself and start the process of getting my dog to be my emotional pet support.
"My family has all had their own individual battles. While we all try and help each other as much as possible, there is only so much one can do. Our dogs, however, have been instrumental in our lives. I started off with an emotional support animal then suggested it to my mom and brother who all have different emotional struggles. I recommended getESA to them because then made me feel welcome to tell them updates. They are prompt with emails which made me feel like someone is truly listening to me a patient and client. My family is very happy with their services. Especially as we all have been moving from place to place around the country, we have a friend and doctor to help us along the way. Thank you."
I love this website. It offers a great service and ease of transaction.
It is an easy application to fill out.  I read all the great recommendations about this organization.
So far so good will rate higher once I receive PDF or documents. Was skeptical at first with this product.
this program is really great it helped me big time and I would definitely refer it to anybody looking from and ESA letter
The process was easy and I received my ESA approval in a timely manner. Anyone that needs an ESA should use this service.
Being a able to have a emotional Support Animal animal has been a blessing to me and helped me in many ways
"Shopping experience was painless, I just hope the letter is forwarded as described."
Great service and site has saved me so much time and money over the years. I appreciate the professionalism.
"GetEsa is a totally user-friendly website. Easy to use and confidential in understanding and using info you submit. Thanks for your help, and easy renewal process."
Renewal Process was pretty simple. I usually only fly Alligent and Frontier so I got the normal fly letter and frontier. I hope if I fly another airline I can order the other airline letters.
"Easy platform, great prices and care for customer's needs. Thank you for the ease of this process!"
The process for getting my animals approved as ESAs is fast and easy. I'm so happy I can travel with them and have them provide the support I need.
Very thorough and easy to navigate. Thanks for reducing the stress level often associated with this technical stuff!!
Emotional support animal service has helped me reach deep into recognizing my illness and why understanding it is so important and valued. Big thank you!
"It was quick and easy. I just put in my personal information, answered a few questions. Then went right to the payment page. Super quick and easy! I've recommended getESA to a bunch of people!! Such a super easy to use site!!"
Very straightforward and easy to follow directions. Simple non-invasive questionnaire.
"Great customer service. Received my letter in only a couple hours, I flew Southwest and they accepted the letter no problem."
Simple and easy to complete forms are especially helpful as difficult / extensive forms  cause me anxiety.
This has been such a blessing. I travel for work and having my pet with me means so much for my emotional well being and for feeling safe.
Love the things that you guys do. Our life would not be the same without your help!
"Everything was easy, but thorough, but I'll know more once I get the letter."
Legitimate and very helpful site that truly connects you with licensed professionals. Everything was done in a reasonable amount of time.
Your site is very easy to navigate and simple questions for renewal make a potentially difficult and uncomfortable process a pleasant experience. Thank you!!
Easy to follow website for information and personalized questions that I had.
"Everything is good, have not talked to dr or received any comfirmations on my dogs papers. So far it good."
Unhappy for not being able to reach my doctor when I needed - costing me an extra $100 on my flight - but really happy with the quick respond I got once I complained about it. Not just a quick respond but I got a new letter with a different doctor in last than an hour.
Great experience thus far! Thank you for making this such an easy process.
"Great service, seems simple enough to use and much more convenient than going to see a therapist. Landlord didn't give any hassle at all either. Definitely recommend!"
This makes the process so easy and calms my stress of making sure my Lucy can remain with me as an ESA during my times of need.
"I love you guys and have recommended this site to sooo many people: coworkers, friends, and even randoms at the dog park! Thank you so much!"
I LEFT A MESSAGE AND I RECEIVE A CALL BACK IN LESS THAN 2 MINUTES ALL MY ANSWERS WE SUCCESSFULLY ANSWERED AND VERY EASY AND FAST. THIS HAS BEEN A BLESSING TO OUR HOME FROM BEING EVICTED. Professional certified and they know what to do. I'm very happy
I found this site via the BBB website and am so very grateful for your help!
"As long as I get the services requested within the time frame I paid for, I will be very happy"
"Finally! Someone to write this letter! I was at such a loss, when none of her therapists could write it, even though they all said she needed an ESD. Thankfully, ( and unfortunately) my brother has many of the same issues and he recommended this site, because he used it. Thank you!!!"
Very quick and easy. Any questions I had were answered by the F&Q page.
So far it's been easy and fast filling the questionnaire. I received my certificate through email in less than 12 hours . I got it in the mail the next week. I'm definitely renewing next year.
Very helpful website and explains information I did not know. Thank you.
"Very easy process. I'm really in need of a support animal and not only is this business accredited, but has tons of awesome reviews."
Easy to complete.  But it didn’t have the time frame to receive the travel form.
"Enjoyed the necessary questions that were asked. I feel this option is perfect, and honestly, was my only option. I cannot afford health insurance, and can no longer get my letter renewed from my previous provider. I truly appreciate this service, because animals truly help on so many levels that many may not understand."
Talking with an actually doctor and being able to have emotional support animals helps with my depression and anxiety while attending college out of state and away from family
"The instructions were very clear and I liked being able to save the work I'd done so far, take a break, and come back later.  I feel confident about the legitimacy of this site because of the good rating from the BBB, also."
Thank you for a straightforward and easy renewal application as well as the ability to receive a letter via email for printing here.
I will rate once I have received follow up . So far I am pleased
"Excellent service, I am so happy that my husband is able to be supported by our dog on our travels."
It was super convenient to do online and come back to finish when I needed to.
Very simple and convenient! Highly recommend. I wish you offered the dog vests during the checkout process.
I don't know I haven't gotten cleared and had a full experience with the final process.
The questionnaire was very thorough. I just started the process but so far I am very pleased.
"The whole process was quick and professional. The letter did come from a certified therapist and she even made corrections for me when I noticed that my school had certain requirements for ESA letters. If you are needing an ESA letter and you either can't afford a therapist or your therapist is refusing to write you one, I strongly recommend using this company."
I have read reviews and been recommended to you guys by a lot of people. I had a great experience.
I had emailed a question that got responded with a direct link to purchase what I was looking for.
I thought I had purchased a support animal vest with my order? Do you not offer this?
It is easy to navigate this website and I am grateful for your services.
"The exam is very easy to respond to and completely thorough. I am grateful for the response I received. I got legal paperwork to help protect me whenever I am flying, and in any housing situation, Thank you for providing this service at a totally reasonable price. I will definitely recommend this Pet Support Site to any and all family and friends."
This renewal was very helpful and my first experience was also perfect.
"So far it was straight forward and easy, but the rating questions come before you actually get any real help or information."
Painless.  I feel so great that I found you.  Can't wait to hear from you.  I can't thank you enough.
"I thought the procedure and price were both very streamlined, easy to understand, and easy to obtain.  I learned about it and purchased it all within a day.  Thank you."
I am so glad I found you. You saved me from being evicted...or have to get rid of my lovely pet.
I've really enjoyed my experience so far and I have already recommended to a lot of my friends who need similar services
I had a question and called them but I could only leave a message.  I was surprised when they called back within 2 minutes and answered all my questions and are expediting my application
"It was a very straight forward process with clear instructions. Hope to get the letter on time now :)
I haven't gotten the letter yet and the whole process is not complete so it's early to rate but everything is great so far."
great service. rapid response. very compassionate and helpful with advice and documentation
A weight of my shoulders how easy it was to use during a difficult time
I can't say enough good things . These doctors really care about me. I give 5 stars .
There are very clear questions and proficient space to answer your questions.
"Quick, easy and very professional staff and support. I am so satisfied with the entire process. Have already recommended this site to others!"
Extremely easy and fast and I feel confident when I take my support with me with no hassles.  We went to a restaurant last night with a friend. If I hadn't been able to take my support with me I would not have gone.  Thank you so much.
Good so far. Everything came in on time and was a very easy process overall!
My therapist is not liscense to certify my pets so I'm glad I can go through this site without having to find a new person just to have this done.
The overall survey was quick and convenient. However the signature portion was difficult.
This was very brief although requires personal information I wish there was more confidential disclosures.
I thank you for taking the time to get me in. I hope that everyone gets the same experience that I got.
"I would like to have seen a protective holder for the ID CARD being sent with it so I can attach it to the vest. If I was supposed to get one, it was not included in the package."
"The forms were easy to fill out and the website looks very professional. The staff was helpful when I had questions and responded quickly. I don't have the time between being a full-time student and working two jobs to schedule an appointment with a therapist in person, so tele-medicine really helped me out here."
"So many options! Wish they were a little more clear. Overall, very helpful website."
I had previously ordered a card but it has not been delivered yet.  I would just like to make sure the new card makes it to my apartment.
"Now that I'm in my late 60 I've become insecure I feel at times, this site made it easy and feeling comfort I can be with my pet and my future travels would be easier THANK YOU"
You guys are so quick to respond and very helpful. I am so very grateful to have found you!
"it was easy to make, great questions they asked for the ESA letter, highly recommend"
I like how easy the form was to fill out and the fact that they will try and use a physician in your area. I also like how fast you can get a response. I would recommend this company to anyone. Glad I found them!!!!!.
Very user friendly and straight forward. I do live in PA and received a doctor in PA.  I did receive everything I paid for however.
"If everything works out, i will be recommending a few people who have been dealing with the same feelings as myself."
This is my second time getting my Rx ESA Letter through this site. They have made it so easy with the detailed letters to travel with my ESA dog.
So far the experience was very simple and straightforward. I am looking forward to receiving my letter.
