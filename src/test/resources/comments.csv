I felt the site is very user friendly and although I was nervous to answer the personal questions they were presented in a manner that helped me feel relaxed.
"Simple and straightforward process.  Clearly presented, so no questions."
"I have had a service with you guys in the past, I have recommended people to you as well."
Since I've had the emotional support life has been great . I didn't know about the yearly renew but I'm okay with that great service and thank you for the yearly reminder and making it so easy
I found your services to be very streamlined and user friendly. You guys truly delivered last year when I needed my ESA letter in a pinch. It was a natural choice to choose you for my ESA letter for 2019.
Renewing my ESA Travel letter and had lots of questions regarding new airline specific letters and they followed up quickly and answered all my questions clearly. you took an uncomfortable situation and made it as pleasant as possible.
Quick response from support team via Email when I had questions.  Fast and friendly service
"Very thorough, and straight to the point.  People within this company are very helpful when I have questions/concerns."
"I have been a client for almost 3 years . Best service, fast , and really professionals"
"So far it's been a good experience. Extremely stressed about everything going on, the ease of this process has helped ease some of that."
"Very easy, thank you! It was so fast, also. It couldn't have been better"
Very good experience. Wasn't difficult at all. I would recommend this service.
If this resource actually ends up working I will love this site forever.
I had a good experience by using this service but still waiting for the letter.
"very quick and easy, professional people who are empathic and competent."
"I am so thankful for this sight. Easy to use, very helpful and no hassles."
Love this online service. Turnaround was very fast and professional.  Lucky to have found this website!
"Service and responses are prompt, courteous, and helpful! I highly recommend."
"So far, process has been smooth.  Much better than ESA of America! I dealt with them for 5 years and will not return to them.  You answer your phones and are friendly!  They don't care about their customers!  They will not do airline forms either.  You offer many services which are helpful for people of disabilities now facing the dreaded airlines!  Thank you!"
First time to try your service and will definitely refer and be back if the order process is smooth and I receive my letter
Thank for your help and service  I will be happy to keep making business with them.
The site made it very easy to renew. I appreciate all the follow-up emails and reminders. Thank you!
I have used your services twice before and have always been happy with  my experience.
So far easy.  I am traveling again 12/20 and need the letters for the dogs before then.  Thank you!
"Received my letters within a week of my request. Very professional and well written. I haven't used either of them yet, but wanted to have them available for when I do. Therefore the final step is not complete until I use them but anticipate no problem."
"Was very easy, you only need to follow the directions and answer the questions"
The site is simple to use and the results will certainly be worth it to bring Penny to visit my family for the holidays!
Very user friendly and am glad to be able to complete the application on line
"Very very quick to reply, awesome customer service, always solving my problems! Thank you, what a blessing!"
I've been using this service for two years now and have never been disappointed!
"This has been the easiest renewal process for me, and my experience over the past year has been great. 0 issues with airlines or my apartment complex with my documentation."
"My mom used the service last year and everything worked great!  They updated letter with our requests in a timely manner.  The ability to get airline specific forms without hassle is great.  She got a letter from the state she lives in. I did not.  Its fine, but I would have preferred a letter from an in state doctor, or a closer state than hawaii when we live in PA.  But its still ok."
"Very well laid out, smooth process, easy functionality.Great experience."
Very highly recommended. The form is extremely easy to fill out and the expedited turnaround was lightning fast! Thank you for simplifying the process!
Became a patient last year and had such a pleasant experience that I've opted to renew a second year. Loved the quick response to my inquiries prior to purchase and really feel appreciated come this 2nd year renewal rate. Highly recommend!!
Everything arrived as stated and promptly. Thank you very much for your assistance!
We are very pleased with this service that has solved a major problem for us
"I believe this site made the process of allowing people like me to add legitimacy to my service animal. My pup adds so much support in my everyday life, and this program allows him to stay with me in all circumstances."
"Just filled out the initial questionnaire, and everything has gone smoothly so far!"
"I am happy and comfortable with this website , the questions are accurate and well asked"
I have recommended your services to many people!! Always fantastic response time and always helping to solve any problems with new airline policies. The best!!! Thank you
So far so good. I love to leave a great review after my first flight with my dog.
"Whenever I have a question, I get a response so quickly.  Thank you for making this stress free!"
Love this! So useful and legitimate. I don't know what I'd do without my dogs. Thank you!
Recommended by a friend. She had a very good experience with them. Will update after i get my ESA
I like that you get a text right away and can check the status of your ESA documentation.
Experience was good- fingers crossed this letter gets approved and I will be fully satisfied with my experience.
The process was helpful and I like that I can save the form in case I need more time to think about my choice.
Service is amazing. I cannot imagine life with my girl by my side. Thank you.
Really quick and affective. Extremely happy and satified with the turn around time and how the professional was able to quickly complete the airline form
I was happy to be able to anonymously apply for this certification as I am too embarrassed to ask my health provider.  But knowing that I can travel with my dog immediately puts my mind at ease and allows me to concentrate on other important things in my life.  Thank you.
So far so good! Haven't heard anything back from my apartment yet! Thanks Cole
"Thank you for being so utterly helpful and kind. I will recommend you kindly to all customers, friends and family."
Easy to fill out form. Got my letter and airline forms within 24hrs. I booked my flight and submitted everything to the airline and everything was approved so easily!
"Thorough, quick service. They ask a lot of question to make sure they are providing you with the recommendation."
I understand why the airlines revise their policies every so often.  It is just a real pleasure when sites like this one makes it easier to comply with the changes.    Thank you.
"I was a little skeptical because the assessment was at the forefront of the website, but we will see."
Only had a problem with uploading a photo to the website for the ID but as long as your Customers Support contacts me for the image I'd say you guys are 1 of the best services for ESA online especially with your specific airline request forms.
"This is the third year I have used GetEsa and each time they executed as stated.  Timely response, good follow up by the doctors."
I'm a returning customer and the experience has been smooth and simple. Thank You.
Your company has been excellent!!!  You have always come through for me on those last minute flights I've taken which required special forms to be completed.  I can't thank you enough!
efficient... and professional.  Thanks for including the option for the Airline specific forms.
The site was fairly easy to use.  I had made an error in processing and it was corrected in a timely matter.  Great customer service.
"As long is my letter is satisfactory, I am quite satisfied and will be recommending this to any of my friends who need similar products."
"I'll have a better sense once I actually receive the letter, but the questionaire was very clear & easy."
I hope I will receive by email my ESA letter allowing me to travel with my dog to CA to visit my daughters soon.
My overall experience has been great. I get a fast response and always am satisfied with the results. The staff is helpful and remains professional at all times.
I thought the signing up process was pretty harmless. I was scared but it was very easy
"So far very easy to use website. I asked for a representative to call me to get more information, an they did within the day! I am hoping this will be accepted by the airline! if not i will be back to post an update!"
The ease of use for my wife was terrific and for myself as well so far.  thank you
Great service always have received necessary forms and assistance. Thank you so much.
It was straightforward and simple to complete. I hope the remaining task to complete is as simple. I am grateful.
we found your company last year and it helped get my pets on a plane to see my family over the holidays.. It was a game changer. thank you for making it happen again this year.
"The process was quick and easy, and I felt that the questions would accurately describe my current mental state and need for an emotional support animal."
"Thank you for the help that you have done to this day and that you are continuing to do. People do not take you for granted and you have helped people tremendously, including myself, thank you!"
I am glad this site makes it so easy. Definitely is needed and to be able to take my ESA with me in apartment living.
So far itâ€™s been a pleasant experience for such an unpleasant situation!
I appreciate this because of my pride. It's hard for me to say I have problems and own up to them in person. So thank you.
I love all of the option you give and how easy it is to fill out. Finally found a legitimate site for my ESAs and not a scam! Thank you so much
"Easy to fill out and submit, easy to renew, quick response time. Very good."
getting an esa letter to decrease my stress has been a stressful experience. emotional pet support helped alleviate that stress
"So far, it was a simple process, but want to get the letter before I give final review."
"Great experience so far!  We just got done with the purchase and will be waiting for the review.  If that goes well, we will ABSOLUTELY come back here as often as needed."
"This is the first time I needed to renew this account, but so far I have been very thankful that I can have access to something i otherwise struggle setting up at a brick and mortar location. I do not get the common leisure of simply going out and running errands, so an online resource is best for a person like me."
Thank you for looking out for people like myself.
I love my pets and wouldnâ€™t be able to work through emotional trauma without them . Thank you.
they are quick in any request I need since I register my pet a year ago!
So far so good. It has the best rate than other esa letter websites I've seen!
Best service I have ever experienced in my entire life. Thank you so much!
This site was easy to find creditable and was able to research on the site what I needed. Adding both of my dogs is a bonus!  And being able to pick up where I left off the day before
I feel hopeful that GetEsa will be a very helpful service that I can come back to year after year!
Easy and straight-forward. Hopefully my documentation will arrive in my inbox soon!
great service and very timely highly recommend. Flew with my pet numerous times now.
I'm interested in getting an ID card if it could an option for lower price
I am so pleased with how easy this process is. It's done quickly and completely and provides the proper documentation needed in order to travel with your emotional support animal.
I just made our first flight with my dog and it was such a comfort. It's a huge relief to know he can travel with me.
"Before doing this application. you awesome customer care support person name Valerie F. helped me out so much on explaining how everything works. thanks so much Lee for all the information, patience and support."
"Easy to use, thorough, and makes me feel that my personal info is safe!"
"I would highly recommend this website, responds super quickly. Helped me keep my best friend."
Both online options and who I spoke with on the phone have been wonderful regarding such a sensitive topic. We will continue to both use your services and recomend you to friends and family in need.
So far the process has been smooth and the professionals are quick to respond.
This was very easy while also being thorough. The documentation was accepted by my apartments.
"This is my second year using GetEsa. They are a great resource for ESA animals, resources and very reasonable in regards to price."
In-depth questions and straightforward process! I feel like I'm in good hands!
Thanks for making this an easy process!  Being able to type out why I need my emotional support pets is so much easier than verbalizing it out loud to someone.
"Quick and easy to renew! However, I do wish that the doctor used was from my state of residence."
"So far it was pretty easy. It was a bit frustrating because I tried to fill out the exam 2 times on Internet Explorer, and ended up having to go to Chrome for it to actually work."
"So far, the site was quick and easy to understand. I look forward to hearing from a professional so that I can get a letter to have my dog with me for emotional support."
Great service very fast and convenient! When I had questions they answer almost immediately!
"Very easy and straightforward. I have had to communicate with the psychologist regarding other concerns after the fact, and she has been wonderful and very easy to reach."
"Easier if I still had computer. Only have fire now! My problem, not yours"
Everything was easy & lots of information to help you understand your rights & the laws. It was hard to take a picture it did not respon & I started over several time because of the box with the area up. I kept hitting by accident & had to start over. Thank you. I hope u are able to help me.
It was fast and easy but also asked the right questions.  I felt safe talking about feelings and expressing my concerns .
This shopping experience was great- easy to follow and covered all the necessary information. I will definitely refer GetEsa to my friends.
Very happy with the initial purchase. Hopefully the forms ordered work with the airlines.
I have been using GetEsa for the past 3 years with excellent service and never had any problems with the airlines.
Customer service has been very quick to respond.  I asked a couple of questions and heard back within minutes of sending. Thank you!
